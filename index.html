        <p>I first came across it in a textbook as a fun example of what is possible with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I thought the game was neat and that it would be a fun challenge to try and recreate on my own.</p>
        <p>There were a few times when I needed to reference other folks' completed code to get mine working, or to get going in the right direction, but I created as much of it on my own as possible. It would be fair to call this a 'guided' project, but I still learned a lot and wrote what I could without help.</p>
        <p>The game still needs a move counter or a timer feature. Something to 'gamify' the project a little more. I saw one version that had an 'auto solve' button. I may add some features later.</p>

            <li>The objective is simple... Turn out all the lights</li>
            <li>Clicking a square toggles the light for that square</li>
            <li>It also toggles squares that share a side with the one you clicked</li>
            <li>Diagonal squares will not be toggled</li>
